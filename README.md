**Un amigo bot** is a conversational bot. The natural language processing part is handled by [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/). **Wit.ai** makes it easy for developers to build applications and devices that you can talk or text to.

It also has a Bot Engine that build bots easily. You tell wit what your user said, and it will tell you what your bot should do next. 

If you are interested in knowing more about **wit.ai** here is the [documentation](https://wit.ai/docs).

**Un amigo bot** was designed to determine via a conversation if a person suffers from depression, and try to help the person to get a better mood, sharing motivational content like phrases, videos or images.
